### Setup

#### `.env` requirements (where applicable)

i.e.

- PORT=3001
<!-- - `MONGODB_URI` - URL to the running mongo instance/db -->

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

- `npm start` or `nodemon`.

#### How to use your library (where applicable)

#### Tests

- How do you run tests?: the tests were written by CF; the tests were run on the command line: npm test.
- Any tests of note? (Possibly too specific to be useful.)
- Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc.: my code initially didn't pass tests 3 (error handling) and 4, but copying the demo code EXACTLY--and only the code that was pushed to GitHub around four or five o'clock--made the tests past. We had to do some sleuthing to get the code base to deploy on heroku.
